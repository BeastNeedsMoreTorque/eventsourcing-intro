# Lagom Persistence


The purpose of this repository it to provide minimal examples, illustrating the core principles of Event Sourcing and CQRS, in the Scala language.

The example use case is a football league. The desired outcome is a representation of the league table, indicating how many games each team has played and how many points they have gathered.

Initially, only an implementation with the Lagom framework has been done.


### To do
Further examples, in Akka Persistence, fun.CQRS and Eventuate.
